      <details>
        <summary>Is this page aimed at end users?</summary>
        <p>
          Not primarily. Most end users won’t care about internal measurement frameworks or safeguard ladders.
          This page is intended to communicate responsibility and operational maturity to investors, partners, and stakeholders.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Do you “monitor everything” users do?</summary>
        <p>
          No. We focus on proportionate operational signals and abuse patterns to manage risk. Privacy remains central to the product.
          Safeguards are designed to be measured, auditable, and minimised to what’s necessary.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Do you use AI for abuse detection?</summary>
        <p>
          We’re building a structured framework that can support anomaly detection over time. Early stages prioritise accurate attribution,
          human review for edge cases, and conservative controls. Automation can be introduced once the signal is reliable.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How do you measure whether a growth channel is working?</summary>
        <p>
          We look at conversion quality (activation and retention), cost discipline (test sizes and budgets), and downstream outcomes
          (paid conversion where applicable). Reach and impressions are not treated as success metrics.
